CLEAR STORAGE (Storage was Almost FULL (97%)
===================================================

Use the CMD 
df



1. Find large directories

Run:

sudo du -h -x --max-depth=1 / | sort -h


That will show which top-level folder (/var, /home, /usr, etc.) is using the most space.

2. Check logs

Logs often grow huge:

sudo du -sh /var/log/*


You can clear old logs safely:

sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d


(keeps only 7 days of logs)

3. Remove unused packages
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo apt clean

4. Look for large files
sudo find / -xdev -type f -size +500M


This lists files bigger than 500MB.

5. If /home is large

Check:

du -sh /home/*


Sometimes backups or videos eat space.

⚠️ If this is a server, do this cleanup carefully — don’t delete system files.

👉 Do you want me to give you a step-by-step cleanup plan to quickly free at least 10–15 GB?





🔎 Step 1: Check what’s eating space

Run:

sudo du -h -x --max-depth=1 / | sort -h


This will show usage of top-level folders (/var, /usr, /home, etc.).
Most likely /var or /usr is big.

🧹 Step 2: Clean package cache

APT stores a lot of .deb files:

sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y

🧹 Step 3: Clear system logs

Journal logs can grow into many GB:

sudo journalctl --disk-usage
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d


(keep only last 7 days)

🧹 Step 4: Remove old kernels

Sometimes old kernels stay installed. Check with:

dpkg --list | grep linux-image


Remove unused ones (but keep the current one):

sudo apt autoremove --purge

🧹 Step 5: Find very large files
sudo find / -xdev -type f -size +500M -exec ls -lh {} \;


This lists files over 500 MB.

🧹 Step 6: Snap (if installed)

If you use snap, old revisions accumulate:

sudo du -h /var/lib/snapd/snaps


Remove old revisions:

sudo snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' | \
while read snapname revision; do sudo snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"; done

✅ Quick Cleanup (safe commands to run now)
sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d




Perfect, now we can see why your disk is full 🚨

Biggest offenders:

/var/log/syslog → 46 GB (!) + 1.1 GB → abnormal, log flooding.

Pip caches → multiple files 500–800 MB each.

PyTorch / CUDA libraries → normal, but they are huge (500 MB – 900 MB each).

Postgres database file → 726 MB (normal if you use PostgreSQL).

Swap image → 4 GB (normal).

So the main reason is syslog flooding. That’s not normal — it means something on your system is spamming the logs.

✅ What you should do
1. Check log size
ls -lh /var/log/syslog*

2. Inspect recent spam
tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog


(look for repeated errors/messages)

⚠️ Fixing the root cause is important, otherwise logs will fill up again.

3. Clean syslog (immediate space recovery)

Stop rsyslog:

sudo systemctl stop rsyslog


Truncate logs:

sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog.1


Start rsyslog again:

sudo systemctl start rsyslog


This instantly frees ~47 GB. 🎉

4. Clear pip cache
pip3 cache purge
sudo rm -rf /root/.cache/pip
rm -rf ~/.cache/pip

5. Optional: Remove old virtualenvs / big libraries

If you have unused Python envs with PyTorch/CUDA, they eat space. Example:

du -sh ~/rokkhi.banglasolutions.com/detection_service/yolo-env


If unused, delete.

🚀 Summary

/var/log/syslog (46 GB) is the main culprit. Truncate it.

Pip caches (several GB). Purge them.

PyTorch libs are big but expected if you use them.

👉 Do you want me to give you a script that automatically cleans logs + pip cache so you don’t have to run all commands manually?
